	<p> <strong>How to Use the Sub Call List</strong>
	<p> Each shift that has a vacancy may have an associated <i>sub call list</i>.  This list keeps track
	of all subs who are available and have/have not been called to fill that vacancy, along with the status of that call.  If nobody has
	tried to fill that shift yet, a new sub call list can be generated.  Here's how it works:
	<p>  To begin, you must have already selected <strong>(edit this week)</strong> at the top of the calendar.
	<p> <B>Step 1:</B> Click on am editable calendar shift that has a vacancy, like this:<BR><BR>
	<a href="tutorial/screenshots/subcallliststep1.gif" class="image" title="subcallliststep1.gif"
			horizontalalign="center" target="tutorial/screenshots/subcallliststep1.gif">
		 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<img src="tutorial/screenshots/subcallliststep1.gif" width="10%" border="1px" align="center"></a>
	<br><br> (Each upcoming calendar shift will turn gray whenever the mouse passes over it.  Shifts for prior days on the calendar cannot
	be edited in this way.)
	<p> <B>Step 2:</B> This will give you a shift form that looks like this:<BR><BR>
	<a href="tutorial/screenshots/subcallliststep2.gif" class="image" title="subcallliststep2.png"
			horizontalalign="center" target="tutorial/screenshots/subcallliststep2.gif">
		 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<img src="tutorial/screenshots/subcallliststep2.gif" width="10%" border="1px" align="center"></a>
	<p> <B>Step 3:</B> If you are the first to try to fill a vacancy for this shift, click on the <B>Generate Sub Call List</B> button, like this:<BR><BR>
		<a href="tutorial/screenshots/subcallliststep3.gif" class="image" title="subcalllistStep3.png"
			horizontalalign="center" target="tutorial/screenshots/subcallliststep3.gif">
		 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<img src="tutorial/screenshots/subcallliststep3.gif" width="10%" border="1px" align="center"></a>
	<BR><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp NOTE: If you are not the first, a sub call list will already have been created, so you should click on
	<B>View Sub Call List</B> button instead.
 		(If there is no <B>Generate/View Sub Call List</B> button, the shift has no vacancies to be filled.)

	<p> <B>Step 4:</B> You will now see a page that lists everyone available to fill that shift, their phone number,
			a 'Date Called' box, a 'Notes' box, and an 'Accepted' box, like this:
  		<br><br> <a href="tutorial/screenshots/subcallliststep4.gif" class="image" title="subcalllistStep4.png"
        	target="tutorial/screenshots/subcallliststep4.gif">
		 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<img src="tutorial/screenshots/subcallliststep4.gif" width="10%" border="1px" align="middle"></a>

	<p> <B>Step 5:</B>   When you call a person to find out if they can fill in, type in the date you called them, and type in any
			notes that apply to the call.  In this example, if I call William Talley on August 17 and leave a message,
			I might enter the following on that shift's sub call list:<BR><BR>
		<a href="tutorial/screenshots/subcallliststep5.gif" class="image" title="subcalllistStep5.png"
        	target="tutorial/screenshots/subcallliststep5.gif">
		 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<img src="tutorial/screenshots/subcallliststep5.gif" width="10%" border="1px" align="middle"></a>
		<br><br> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp If they accept or reject your request, select "Yes" or "No" in the 'Accepted' box.

	<p> <B>Step 6:</B>  When you are finished with the sub call list for that shift, click on the <B>Assign Subs/Save Changes</B> button, like this.<BR><BR>
		<a href="tutorial/screenshots/subcallliststep6.gif" class="image" title="subcalllistStep6.png"
        	target="tutorial/screenshots/subcallliststep6.gif">
		 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<img src="tutorial/screenshots/subcallliststep6.gif" width="10%" border="1px" align="middle"></a>
		<br><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp NOTE: If you fail to save your changes, any work you have done with this list will be lost.  So this is a very important step;
			you don't want other volunteers working with this shift's sub call list at a later time to duplicate your efforts and call the same
			person again.

	<p> <B>Step 7:</B>  Now that the Date Called, Notes, "Yes"s and "No"s are saved, you will see a page showing all the open sub call lists on the
			calendar, like this:
	<br><br>	<a href="tutorial/screenshots/subcallliststep7.gif" class="image" title="subcalllistStep7.png"
        	target="tutorial/screenshots/subcallliststep7.gif">
		 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<img src="tutorial/screenshots/subcallliststep7.gif" width="10%" border="1px" align="middle"></a>
	<br><br>If you had selected "Yes" in <b>Step 5</b>, the vacancy will automatically be filled
			on the active calendar. If that is the last vacancy to be filled on this shift, its sub call list will be "closed."
			Otherwise, its sub call list will remain "open."

	<br><br>You can now click on any other "open" sub call list on this list to find out its current status and try to fill another vacancy.

	<p> <B>Step 8:</B>  You can return to the shift, the calendar, or any other function by selecting it on the navigation bar.
