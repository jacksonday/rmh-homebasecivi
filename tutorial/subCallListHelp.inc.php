	<strong>How to Use the Sub Call List</strong>
<p>
	Each shift that has a vacancy may have an associated <i>sub call list</i>.
	This list keeps track of all subs who are available and have/have not
	been called to fill that vacancy, along with the status of that call.
	If nobody has tried to fill that shift yet, a new sub call list can be
	generated. Here's how it works:
<p>
	To begin, you must have already selected <strong>(edit this week)</strong>
	at the top of the calendar.
<p>
	<B>Step 1:</B> Click on am editable calendar shift that has a vacancy,
	like this:<BR>
	<BR> <a href="tutorial/screenshots/subcallliststep1.gif" class="image"
		title="subcallliststep1.gif" horizontalalign="center"
		target="tutorial/screenshots/subcallliststep1.gif">
		&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<img
		src="tutorial/screenshots/subcallliststep1.gif" width="10%"
		border="1px" align="center">
	</a> <br>
	<br> (Each upcoming calendar shift will turn gray whenever the mouse
	passes over it. Shifts for prior days on the calendar cannot be edited
	in this way.)
<p>
	<B>Step 2:</B> This will give you a shift form that looks like this:<BR>
	<BR> <a href="tutorial/screenshots/subcallliststep2.gif" class="image"
		title="subcallliststep2.png" horizontalalign="center"
		target="tutorial/screenshots/subcallliststep2.gif">
		&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<img
		src="tutorial/screenshots/subcallliststep2.gif" width="10%"
		border="1px" align="center">
	</a>
<p>
	<B>Step 3:</B> If you are the first to try to fill a vacancy for this
	shift, click on the <B>Generate Sub Call List</B> button, like this:<BR>
	<BR> <a href="tutorial/screenshots/subcallliststep3.gif" class="image"
		title="subcalllistStep3.png" horizontalalign="center"
		target="tutorial/screenshots/subcallliststep3.gif">
		&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<img
		src="tutorial/screenshots/subcallliststep3.gif" width="10%"
		border="1px" align="center">
	</a> <BR>
	<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp NOTE: If you are not the first, a sub call list
	will already have been created, so you should click on <B>View Sub Call
		List</B> button instead. (If there is no <B>Generate/View Sub Call
		List</B> button, the shift has no vacancies to be filled.)
<p>
	<B>Step 4:</B> You will now see a page that lists everyone available to
	fill that shift, their phone number, a 'Date Called' box, a 'Notes'
	box, and an 'Accepted' box, like this: <br>
	<br> <a href="tutorial/screenshots/subcallliststep4.gif" class="image"
		title="subcalllistStep4.png"
		target="tutorial/screenshots/subcallliststep4.gif">
		&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<img
		src="tutorial/screenshots/subcallliststep4.gif" width="10%"
		border="1px" align="middle">
	</a>
<p>
	<B>Step 5:</B> When you call a person to find out if they can fill in,
	type in the date you called them, and type in any notes that apply to
	the call. In this example, if I call William Talley on August 17 and
	leave a message, I might enter the following on that shift's sub call
	list:<BR>
	<BR> <a href="tutorial/screenshots/subcallliststep5.gif" class="image"
		title="subcalllistStep5.png"
		target="tutorial/screenshots/subcallliststep5.gif">
		&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<img
		src="tutorial/screenshots/subcallliststep5.gif" width="10%"
		border="1px" align="middle">
	</a> <br>
	<br> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp If they accept or reject your request, select
	"Yes" or "No" in the 'Accepted' box.
<p>
	<B>Step 6:</B> When you are finished with the sub call list for that
	shift, click on the <B>Assign Subs/Save Changes</B> button, like this.<BR>
	<BR> <a href="tutorial/screenshots/subcallliststep6.gif" class="image"
		title="subcalllistStep6.png"
		target="tutorial/screenshots/subcallliststep6.gif">
		&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<img
		src="tutorial/screenshots/subcallliststep6.gif" width="10%"
		border="1px" align="middle">
	</a> <br>
	<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp NOTE: If you fail to save your changes, any work
	you have done with this list will be lost. So this is a very important
	step; you don't want other volunteers working with this shift's sub
	call list at a later time to duplicate your efforts and call the same
	person again.
<p>
	<B>Step 7:</B> Now that the Date Called, Notes, "Yes"s and "No"s are
	saved, you will see a page showing all the open sub call lists on the
	calendar, like this: <br>
	<br> <a href="tutorial/screenshots/subcallliststep7.gif" class="image"
		title="subcalllistStep7.png"
		target="tutorial/screenshots/subcallliststep7.gif">
		&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<img
		src="tutorial/screenshots/subcallliststep7.gif" width="10%"
		border="1px" align="middle">
	</a> <br>
	<br>If you had selected "Yes" in <b>Step 5</b>, the vacancy will
	automatically be filled on the active calendar. If that is the last
	vacancy to be filled on this shift, its sub call list will be "closed."
	Otherwise, its sub call list will remain "open." <br>
	<br>You can now click on any other "open" sub call list on this list to
	find out its current status and try to fill another vacancy.
<p>
	<B>Step 8:</B> You can return to the shift, the calendar, or any other
	function by selecting it on the navigation bar.
